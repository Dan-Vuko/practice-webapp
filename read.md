**OH.** Okay, NOW we're talking real volume. Each click = one 1232 cell execution.

At 120 BPM: **120 cells/minute = 7,200 reps/hour**

That changes everything.

## **Single Session Structure** (60-90 minutes)

### Warm-up Block (5 minutes)
- 80 BPM for 2 minutes = **160 reps**
- 100 BPM for 3 minutes = **300 reps**
- Total: ~450 reps, just getting online

### **Working Blocks** (4-6 blocks of 8-12 minutes each)

Each block:
1. **Target tempo** (whatever puts you at 65-75% accuracy)
2. Run for **8-12 minutes straight**
3. At 200 BPM: 1,600-2,400 reps per block
4. When technique starts collapsing (you feel surround inhibition kicking in): **stop**
5. Rest **3-5 minutes** (let central fatigue dissipate)

**Don't push through degraded reps** - you're just reinforcing sloppy motor patterns once M1 control breaks down.

**Target: 4 working blocks = 6,400-9,600 reps in the failure zone**

### Overspeed Intervals (inserted between working blocks)

During the 3-5 min rest:
- After 2 minutes recovery: **30-45 seconds at 110-120% max tempo**
- Will be chaotic, barely controlled
- At 280 BPM: ~140-210 reps at "WTF" speed
- Purpose: Neural recruitment above normal operating range

### Cool-down (5 minutes)
- Drop to 70% of max tempo
- 5 minutes of clean, automatic execution
- ~600-800 reps locking in good patterns

## **Session Volume Reality Check**

**Total session (75 minutes):**
- Warm-up: ~450 reps
- 4 working blocks @ 10 min each: ~8,000 reps
- 4 overspeed bursts: ~600 reps  
- Cool-down: ~700 reps
- **Grand total: ~9,750 reps**

## **App Features That Matter Now**

### 1. **Block Timer**
- "Working Block 1: 10:00 remaining"
- Auto-stops at 12 minutes (enforces rest)
- Displays: "2,347 reps this block"

### 2. **Real-time Rep Counter**
- Just counts clicks
- "Session total: 6,429"
- "This week: 31,207"

### 3. **Tempo Progression Logic**

**Within-session:**
- Start at -20% of yesterday's peak
- After 5 minutes clean, bump +10 BPM
- Find the tempo where you're barely hanging on
- Stay there for 30-40 minutes of total working time

**Week-to-week:**
- Log "highest tempo sustained for 10+ minutes"
- When you hit 10 clean minutes at tempo X, that becomes your new baseline
- Next week's working tempo = X + 10-15 BPM

### 4. **Fatigue Detection**
- "You've been at 220 BPM for 11 minutes - technique degrading? [Yes] [No]"
- If Yes → auto-stops, forces 3-min rest
- Learns your fatigue patterns over time

### 5. **Overspeed Scheduler**
- Pops up during rest periods: "Ready for overspeed? 45 sec @ 280 BPM"
- [Skip] [Go]

### 6. **Weekly Volume Tracking**
```
Week 12 Summary:
Monday: 9,847 reps
Tuesday: 10,203 reps  
Thursday: 9,651 reps
Friday: 10,089 reps
Saturday: 4,112 reps
—————————————————
Total: 43,902 reps

Peak tempo sustained 10+ min: 235 BPM
(+15 BPM from Week 11)

## **The Monthly Progression**

**Month 1: Building the engine**
- Working tempo: 180-200 BPM
- Weekly volume: 40,000-45,000 reps
- Goal: Establish baseline, build work capacity

**Month 2: First speed push**  
- Working tempo: 200-220 BPM
- Weekly volume: 42,000-48,000 reps
- Myelination from Month 1 paying off

**Month 3: Consolidation + second push**
- Working tempo: 220-240 BPM
- Weekly volume: 45,000-50,000 reps
- Week 12: Deload to 30,000 reps

**Month 4: Approaching biological limits**
- Working tempo: 240-260 BPM
- Progress slows (muscle relaxation rate ceiling)
- Each +5 BPM takes 2-3 weeks now

## **Why This Volume Works**

At **10,000 reps per session**:
- You're spending 30-40 minutes in the failure zone (6,000-8,000 reps barely controlled)
- That's enough stimulus to trigger myelination, LTP, motor unit adaptation
- But split across 4 blocks with rest, so central fatigue doesn't accumulate destructively
- The overspeed bursts recruit motor units you don't access at working tempos

The **44,000 reps/week** = enough volume for structural neural changes, but distributed to avoid overtraining.

**Critical insight**: At this volume, you're not limited by willpower or "practice discipline." You're limited by **central nervous system recovery**. That's why the rest days are mandatory—M1 needs 48 hours to clear accumulated inhibition and restore corticospinal excitability.

## **What Kills Progress at This Level**

1. **Practicing through fatigue** - After 12-15 minutes at peak tempo, your M1 surround inhibition breaks down. Continuing just burns in sloppy patterns.

2. **Insufficient rest days** - Training 6-7 days/week at this volume = accumulated central fatigue = plateau in 3-4 weeks.

3. **No deload weeks** - Every 4th week, drop volume by 30-40% or speed gains stall.

4. **Ignoring muscle relaxation rate** - At some point (~260-280+ BPM for fingers), you hit physiological ceiling. No amount of reps breaks through—you'd need different training (plyometric-type work for faster calcium reuptake, if that even transfers).

Make sense now? We're talking **40,000-50,000 weekly reps**, not 40.
